# Fund4U
Fund4U is a fundraising platform built using Phonegap. It uses PHP in the backend with SQL database.

Fund4U is a platform that acts like a bridge between the project owners and the backers. It provides with an opportunity to 
get the amount of money that a creator needs to complete their project. 

The User/Project owner can signup on our application. After signing up, they can see all the featured projects that are currently live. 
There are various categories of projects such as Art, Film & Television, Technology etc. The user can select projects based on the 
categories listed in the menu. The Project owner has the option to create his project once he fills up the project owner form. 
The project owner form takes all the details of the project from the owner and verifies if the owner is legit or not. 
These details also include the rewards that the owner offers to the backer. 

After verification, the project is visible to everyone in the list of projects. The project owner also has a dashboard. 
He can see the status of his project and the list of people who are backing up his project. The backer on the other hand can 
look at the description of any project and if he likes it, he can click on “back this project” button and he has to sign the backer form. 
Then he will be redirected to a payment page and after successful payment, the owner sends the promised reward to the backer. 
Any project is live for a maximum of 45 days. If the project meets the required fundraising goal in this timeline, all the
money is sent to the project owner. If there is not enough funding in that time-period, all the money is sent back to the backers.
